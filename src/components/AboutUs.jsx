                        <h2><b>Vision</b></h2>
                        <p>To enrich the quality of life for everyone in India by facilitating better connectivity between people and places.</p>
                        <br />


                        <h1><b>Mission</b></h1>

                        <p>To make Kochi a more liveable and pleasant city for residents and visitors alike, where public transportation would be used by all - connecting people and places safely, seamlessly, reliably and comfortably.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h1><b>Towards an Integrated Transportation System</b></h1>

                        <p>Five years ago, Kochi Metro Rail Limited was started with the objective of building and running a metro line, but later we decided to use KMRL as an opportunity to migrate citizens from personal vehicles to public transport and change the face of transportation and mobility in the process. KMRL is trying to build itself as Kerala's urban transport solutions provider. By being the first metro system in the country with an integrated multimodal transport system, Kochi Metro will not only give the city a much-required face-lift but also provide an end-to-end connectivity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our objective is to make Kochi the first city in the country where the entire public transport system: the metro, the buses, the boats, the auto-rickshaws and the taxies work together as a seamless integrated system; with a common timetable, common ticketing and centralised command and control'.
                        </p>
                        <br />
